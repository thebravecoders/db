The Object.groupBy() static method groups the elements of a given iterable according to the string values returned by a provided callback function. The returned object has separate properties for each group, containing arrays with the elements in the group.<br /><br />This method should be used when group names can be represented by strings. If you need to group elements using a key that is some arbitrary value, use Map.groupBy() instead.
